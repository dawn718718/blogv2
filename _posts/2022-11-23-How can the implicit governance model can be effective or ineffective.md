How can the implicit governance model can be effective or ineffective. This was the assignment from the Content Strategy Class at school.  
Here is my thought, which is the same article handed in to the professor.   

Many factors influence which content governance model a company adopts, but I think the company's size is the most dominant factor. Most big companies have a single-focused channel for centralized communication to manage products and services across different regions and tiers of the organization. But it appears that small or medium-sized companies (most organizations) have a loosely dispersed governance model in managing content. This means they do not have content leadership, but each subsidiary has an independent structure for managing the communication and content.  

Here are the pros and cons of the implicit governance model.  

Pros: It allows quick decision-making. People can avoid the heavy process or centralized messages directed by the head office in planning and operating the communication methodology. Eventually, it can help the organization save time and money. And the other beneficial point is that it fosters the creativity of the content-managing person or small communication team. Also, this approach has an easy reporting line and allows an inventive mood within the subsidiary.  

Cons: To look at the aspect where this non-centralized model is inefficient, the absence of a strong and central place to run the communication strategy can confuse the audiences. Since each communication person does not share the same tools or cannot be directed with clear ownership from the organization, it lacks brand consistency. Additionally, from the management perspective, they might suffer from the unmanaged communication channel when the organization must present and promote consistent content.
